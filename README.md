# FinalYearProject

My university final year project.

This project is a web application which is designed to improve the efficiency of the service department at the company I currently work at
by replacing the current paper-based system and enabling service engineers to focus on repair work.

Features include:
  Online submission of a fault
  Repair progress tracking
  Knowledge database
  Auto emails sent to the required person
  Quote production
